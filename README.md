# Rubix ML - Human Activity Recognizer
This example project demonstrates the problem of human activity recognition (HAR) using mobile phone sensor data recorded from the gyroscope and accelerometer. The training data are the human annotated sensor readings of 30 volunteers while performing various tasks such as sitting, standing, walking, and laying down. Each sample contains a window of 561 features, however, we demonstrate that with a technique called *random projection* we can reduce the dimensionality down to 110 without any loss in accuracy. The learner we'll train to accomplish our task is a [Softmax Classifier](https://docs.rubixml.com/en/latest/classifiers/softmax-classifier.html) which is the multiclass generalization of Logistic Regression.

## Tutorial

### Introduction
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (walking, walking up stairs, walking down stairs, sitting, standing, and laying) wearing a smartphone on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were recorded at a constant rate of 50Hz. The sensor signals were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 seconds. Our objective is to build a classifier to recognize which of the activities a user is performing given this sensor data.

> **Note:** The source code for this example can be found in the [train.php](https://github.com/RubixML/HAR/blob/master/train.php) file in project root.

### Extracting the Data
The data are given to us in multiple CSV files within the `train` and `test` folders. Each folder contains a `samples.csv` and `labels.csv` file. Let us start by importing The PHP League's [CSV Reader](https://csv.thephpleague.com/) to help us extract the data from the source files.

```php
use League\Csv\Reader;

$samples = Reader::createFromPath(__DIR__ . '/train/samples.csv')
    ->setDelimiter(',')->setEnclosure('"')->getRecords();

$labels = Reader::createFromPath(__DIR__ . '/train/labels.csv')
    ->setDelimiter(',')->setEnclosure('"')->fetchColumn(0);
```

The `getRecords()` and `fetchColumn` methods on the Reader instance both return iterators which we'll use to instantiate a new [Labeled](https://docs.rubixml.com/en/latest/datasets/labeled.html) dataset object using the static `fromIterator()` method.

```php
use Rubix\ML\Datasets\Labeled;

$dataset = Labeled::fromIterator($samples, $labels);
```

### Dataset Preparation
The first thing we'll do to prepare the dataset is convert all numerical strings to their integer and floating point counterparts. This step is necessary because the CSV Reader imports everything as a string by default. The [Numeric String Converter](https://docs.rubixml.com/en/latest/transformers/numeric-string-converter.html) is a transformer that will handle the conversion for us.

In machine learning, dimensionality reduction is often employed to compress the input samples such that most or all of the information is preserved. By reducing the number of input features to a denser representation, we can speed up the training process by using more informative samples. [Random Projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_projection) is a computationally efficient unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique based on the [Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma) which states that a set of points in a high-dimensional space can be embedded into a space of much lower dimension in such a way that distances between the points are nearly preserved. The next transformation we'll apply to the dataset is a [Gaussian Random Projector](https://docs.rubixml.com/en/latest/transformers/gaussian-random-projector.html) that applies a randomized linear transformation sampled from a Gaussian distribution. We'll set the target number of dimensions to 110 which is less than 20% of the original input dimensionality.

Lastly, we'll center and scale the dataset using [Z Scale Standardizer](https://docs.rubixml.com/en/latest/transformers/z-scale-standardizer.html) such that the values of the features have mean 0 and unit variance. This last step will help the learner converge to a minima of the gradient quicker during training.

Since we'll be needing these transformations again in our validation script, we'll wrap them in a [Pipeline](https://docs.rubixml.com/en/latest/pipeline.html) object so that they can be persisted with the model. Pipeline is a meta-Estimator that automates the fitting and transformations of incoming datasets.

### Instantiating the Learner
The [Softmax Classifier](https://docs.rubixml.com/en/latest/classifiers/softmax-classifier.html) is a single layer neural network with a [Softmax](https://docs.rubixml.com/en/latest/neural-network/activation-functions/softmax.html) output layer. Training is done iteratively with mini batch Gradient Descent where at each epoch the model parameters take a step in the direction of the gradient of a user-defined cost function such as [Cross Entropy](https://docs.rubixml.com/en/latest/neural-network/cost-functions/cross-entropy.html).

The first hyper-parameter of Softmax Classifier is the batch size which controls the number of samples that are feed into the network at a time. The batch size trades off training speed for smoothness of the gradient estimate. A batch size of 200 works pretty well for this example.

The next hyper-parameter is the Gradient Descent optimizer. The [Momentum](https://docs.rubixml.com/en/latest/neural-network/optimizers/momentum.html) optimizer is an adaptive optimizer that adds a momentum force to every parameter update. Momentum helps to speed up the learning process by traversing the gradient quicker. It uses a global *learning rate* that can be set by the user and typically ranges from 0.1 to 0.0001. The default setting of 0.001 works fairly well for this example so we'll leave it at that.

```php
use Rubix\ML\Pipeline;
use Rubix\ML\PersistentModel;
use Rubix\ML\Transformers\NumericStringConverter;
use Rubix\ML\Transformers\GaussianRandomProjector;
use Rubix\ML\Transformers\ZScaleStandardizer;
use Rubix\ML\Classifiers\SoftmaxClassifier;
use Rubix\ML\NeuralNet\Optimizers\Momentum;
use Rubix\ML\Persisters\Filesystem;


$estimator = new PersistentModel(
    new Pipeline([
        new NumericStringConverter(),
        new GaussianRandomProjector(110),
        new ZScaleStandardizer(),
    ], new SoftmaxClassifier(200, new Momentum(0.001))),
    new Filesystem('har.model')
);
```

We'll wrap the entire pipeline in a [Persistent Model](https://docs.rubixml.com/en/latest/persistent-model.html) meta-estimator that adds a `save()` and `load()` method to the base estimator. Persistent Model requires a [Persister](https://docs.rubixml.com/en/latest/persisters/api.html) object to tell it where to store the serialized model data. The [Filesystem](https://docs.rubixml.com/en/latest/persisters/filesystem.html) persister saves and loads the model data to a file located at a user-specified path in storage.

### Setting a Logger
Softmax Classifier implements the [Verbose](https://docs.rubixml.com/en/latest/verbose.html) interface and therefore can log the progress of the learner during training. To set a logger, pass a [PSR-3](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/) compatible logger instance to the `setLogger()` method on the estimator instance. The built-in [Screen](https://docs.rubixml.com/en/latest/other/loggers/screen.html) logger is a good default choice.

```php
use Rubix\ML\Other\Loggers\Screen;

$estimator->setLogger(new Screen('HAR'));
```

### Training
To start training the learner, call the `train()` method on the instance with the training dataset as an input argument.

```php
$estimator->train($dataset);
```

### Training Loss
During training, the learner will record the training loss at each epoch which we can plot to visualize the training progress. To return an array with the values of the cost function at each epoch call the `steps()` method on the learner.

```php
$losses = $estimator->steps();
```

This is an example of a line plot of the Cross Entropy cost function from start to finish. You should see fast learning in the early epochs with slower learning near the end as the learner fine-tunes the model parameters.

### Saving
To save the model simply call the `save()` method on the estimator instance.

```php
$estimator->save();
```

### Cross Validation
